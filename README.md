# odin-landing-page

This will be a landing page that is as close as possible to an example web page provided by The Odin Project.

To create the page, I will use the HTML, CSS, and Flexbox skills that I have learned so far, along with my ability to debug, and find solutions to any problems I encounter
by utilizing google, as well as other members of the community.
